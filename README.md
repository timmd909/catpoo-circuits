Circuit designs for my CATPOO project

The Adafruit Permaproto route has it's limitations. Time, now, to learn how
to create PCBs.

## Special Thanks

* [Arduino Micro shield](https://github.com/adamf/arduino_micro_shield) - Good reference
* [OSHPark](https://oshpark.com) - For printing out beautiful PCBs
* [DRV 8825 Stepper Driver](http://fritzing.org/projects/drv-8825-stepper-motor-carrier-high-current) - Very
  close to the [DRV 8834 stepper drivers](https://www.pololu.com/product/2134)
  used in this project.
